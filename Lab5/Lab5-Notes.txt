Lab 5 was originally intended to introduce unit testing, but the approach I have taken in rewriting the labs in python replaces Lab 1 with an introduction to makefiles with regard to python,
and an introduction to unit tests.  Each lab from then on is intended to instruct the student to write unit tests for each of the functions that they write, as this is proper development 
practice.
